        <div class="qoute">
            <p class="oq">"</p>
            <div class="nolan">
                <p class="joseph-qoute">I believe cinema is a medium that allows us to explore the most intricate and ambitious narratives, challenging the traditional conventions of storytelling. It's not about spoon-feeding the audience; it's about inviting them to actively participate, to piece together the puzzle we lay before them. That's why I'm drawn to complex narratives that play with time and reality, as they mirror the complexities of the human mind.</p>
                <p class="joseph-qoute">I'm a firm believer in the power of practical filmmaking. Embracing traditional techniques, shooting on film, using practical effects — these choices bring a tangible authenticity to the screen. The visual experience should be immersive, evoking emotions and transporting the audience into our cinematic worlds.</p>
                <p class="joseph-qoute">Sound is another crucial element of the cinematic journey. It's not just about what you see; it's about what you hear. I collaborate closely with skilled sound designers to craft an auditory experience that complements and enhances the visuals, elevating the emotional impact.</p>
                <p class="joseph-qoute">Cinema, for me, is a canvas to explore profound psychological themes and philosophical questions. Memory, identity, morality, and the nature of reality fascinate me endlessly. I want to challenge the audience to question their perceptions, to provoke thought and introspection.</p>
                <p class="joseph-qoute">Blending genres allows us to push the boundaries and reach a wider audience. Science fiction, action, and psychological thrillers — these genres can coalesce to create something fresh and engaging.</p>
                <p class="joseph-qoute">The creative process is vital to me. I'm deeply involved in all aspects of filmmaking, from inception to the final cut. It's about having a dedicated team, all on the same wavelength, working together to bring the vision to life.</p>
                <p class="joseph-qoute">Ultimately, cinema is an art form that should leave an impact. It should resonate with people long after they leave the theater. I strive to create films that linger in the mind, leaving the audience with questions and a hunger for more. That's my vision of cinema.</p>
